NO ME TOO
=========

This script copies the selected tracks or playlists from iTunes to an arbitrary folder (e.g. USB Drive, MP3 Player or preferably a Nokia Phone in USB Drive mode) 

What you need:
--------------
1. Windows (with Windows Scripting Host)
2. iTunes
3. an MP3 player which can act as a USB Mass Storage Device

Usage:
------
src/nometoo.js has some function which when correctly assembled will copy the files from iTunes to a destination
see test/nometoo.js and src/nometoo-starter.js for examples

The story behind it:
--------------------

Ovi Music on Windows is too bloated and slow for me and since I already use iTunes I didn't want yet another music library manager.
I would appreciate if Nokia would port it's Multimedia Transfer from Mac to Windows, but since that didn't happen yet and I'm very impatient I started this little helper script.
The "NO ME TOO" is a tribute to Nokia Multimedia Transfer... 

Thanks:
