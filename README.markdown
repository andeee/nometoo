NO ME TOO
=========

This script copies the selected tracks from iTunes to any arbitrary folder (e.g. USB Drive, MP3 Player or preferable a Nokia Phone in USB Drive mode) 

When a playlist is selected in iTunes it also tries to recreate the Playlist as a M3U file.

What you need:
--------------
1. Windows (with Windows Scripting Host)
2. iTunes
3. an MP3 player which can act as a USB Mass Storage Device

Restrictions:
-------------
My first try is a little rough around the edges:
*  It reads the destination path from the registry
*  Only displays a stupid german message when it's finished copying
*  No tests (very bad, one of the first things I will fix)
*  It assumes a Playlists folder relative to the destination folder

The story behind it:
--------------------
Ovi Music on Windows is too bloated for me, since I already use iTunes I simply wanted to copy some tracks from iTunes to my Nokia Phone
I would appreciate if Nokia ported it's Multimedia Transfer from Mac to Windows, but since I'm very impatient I started this thingy.
The "NO ME TOO" is a tribute to Nokia Multimedia Transfer... Yes I am very creative!
